# [Cutting Pork](https://mikekreiser.me/cutting-pork)

This is a CS 465 UI Design group project at the University of Illinois authored by June You, Junze He, Mike Kreiser, and Robby Glahe. 

### Summary 
There are a few problems our UI design project “Cutting Pork” seeks to alleviate. The problems originate in the political sphere of our culture. The first problem is that our political system in America is obscure. A second problem is that is it difficult to effectively track a politician’s actions and record, or hold them accountable. Finally, many voters are uninformed and even worse, a large portion of people do not vote. We intend to create an online interface that takes steps to solve these problems and cut through propaganda supplied by the political system.

### Running Instructions 
- Run "npm install" and "bower install" within main folder to install dependencies
- Run "grunt" to build (there may be dependencies that we have missed, please npm install them as they show up)
- Run "grunt serve" and a new tab of our protoype will show up 

A live version of the prototype can be found at http://mikekreiser.me/cutting-pork/#/
